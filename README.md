# Algorithms

Algorithms is a project developed as part of the "Trybe" course to simulate simple functions using Python and some of its libraries.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **Check if a word is an anagram**.
- **Find a duplicate value within a list**.
- **Check if a word is a palindrome**.
- **Encrypt messages**.

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **Python**
- **PIB**
- **Pytest**

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git@github.com:PedroEmmanuelBuerger/project-algorithms.git`.
2. Ensure you have the PIB library for Python installed, then run the command: `pip install`.
3. To run the tests, execute: `python3 run tests`.

## Key Learnings

The main learning was how to identify the complexity of a code, such as how much memory it uses and how long it takes to execute. It was also possible to learn various ways to handle code in different situations to reduce its complexity, working with lists in both recursive and iterative formats, all in Python. Additionally, it was great for becoming familiar with the language and its libraries, like pytest.

## Conclusion

The application was an excellent starting point for applying computer science concepts and also a great way to refine my skills with the Python language, using its tools and various libraries.
